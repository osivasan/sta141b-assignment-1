It is a quick exercise for you to get familiar with RStudio, Rmarkdown and GitHub. Please
edit the following R block and update the variable `my_name` with your information. Then knit the document to either a pdf or html file.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_name <- "Oviya S"
```

Hello to the world, I am `r my_name`.


## Get a random quote!

<!-- Don't worry if you don't understand the following, these are the things we are going to learn. -->

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(httr)
results <- GET("https://api.kanye.rest")
if (status_code(results) != 200) {
    stop("cannot fetch any quote")
}
```
"`r content(results)$quote`".
